            In 2012, I started my study in Computer Science. I have earned my Bachelor of Science from Ball State, and I am getting my degree of Master of Science in this coming May. On the verge of completing my master’s degree, I ask myself a question again and again — Should I find a job as a web developer, or should I expand my knowledge more in the relevant field? This is what I have inquired for a long time. I have always been drawn to the overlap between design and development.

                    </p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past six years, I took several theoretical courses in algorithms, complexity theory, and programming languages, as well as practical courses in database design, operating systems, mobile design, and software engineering methodology. When I review my projects, they are practical, stable, and effective, but all of them seem to fall short in their designs. I believe that I have accumulated a lot of programming experiences, but I may be lack designing skills. After learning how a project works behind scenes, I would like to gain more knowledge on the aesthetic aspect of the program and its usability. In addition, I believe that storytelling is a big part of a modern approach to website/app design. A design without a story is lifeless and unattractive. In contrast, incorporating stories in the design can bring the design to life by attracting users visually and encouraging participation and communication, which I would like to learn more. Personally, I love traveling and capturing the remarkable moments. My ideal part-time job is to travel around the world and post travel diaries providing inspiration to people. 
  </p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told by my friends that there will be a lot of reading in this program that is not intimidating because I enjoy reading a lot. Hopefully, through this reading journey, I could improve my English literacy dramatically and acquire better communication skills because being articulate and well-spoken is of great help in any profession. In addition, I have conducted research experience in computer science throughout my current master’s degree, but research in a different area would broaden my knowledge and insights. Thus, conducting research in both science and telecommunication can be very interesting and promising. Even though I have little experience in video/audio production, I can apply the skills I gained from Computer Science to digital storytelling. Moreover, I do have a willing heart to learn. I believe, at the end of the two-year program, I am be able to accomplish either a creative project or a research paper with my artistic creativity and abundant knowledge. 
  </p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my rich academic background in Computer Science, I believe that I have well-prepared for your respected program. Moreover, I am mostly proud of my working experience as a graduate assistant. This position has allowed me to serve as a support resource for undergraduate students. There are many students who struggle to grasp the topics in their courses, with my help, they are able to gain a deeper understanding of the subject. I also gain a lot of joy by helping them.

                  </p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In my portfolio section, I placed screenshots of two websites I’ve built, along with some motion graphics. Those motion graphics are everyday life photos. I picked my favorite ones. The first website is called cat rescue. It was my first React.js project. It’s purely a design project; there is no backend, but I am going to add more functions later on. I used React.js as a frame, css to  add styles, and sass to preprocess css. The purpose of building this site is to provide information to people who are interested in adopting/volunteering/sponsoring cats. Users can simply fill out information online, and then go to the shelter if they get approved. The site is designed to encourage people to help homeless cats. It’s also mobile-friendly.
</p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another website is called ice cream shop. It uses asp.net and is a dynamic website for online customers ordering ice cream. Users can register and login to order their favorites for delivery. Customers can retrieve addresses or orders when they login. All information is saved to a database. Users are able to reset their password and receive an email with a random password. Various functionalities include: mobile-first design, multiple language support, and tutorials for the site. Techniques used in this project: Used asp.net to build the interface, design a relational model database, and create the table structure in MySQL. Created responsive interfaces using HTML5, CSS, CSS3 and Bootstrap (Grid System, button, navigation etc.). Developed dynamic interfaces with JavaScript (such as validating data, event handling, object visibility and client interactivity, etc.). Used JQuery for selectors, event functions, effects, and modifying HTML. Used plug-ins for features such as navigation drawers, CAPTCHA verification, slides for the homepage, and zoom-in-out for pictures.
